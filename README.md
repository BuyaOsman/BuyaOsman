# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Ayub -> Buya!

I'm an aspiring Quantitative Analyst with a passion for leveraging data, algorithms, and financial models to make informed trading decisions. My journey into the world of quant trading is fueled by a deep curiosity for the intersection of finance, mathematics, and technology.

- **Quant Trading**: Currently diving deep into statistical models, machine learning, and financial markets. Learning the ins and outs of trading strategies, risk management, and quantitative analysis.
- **Coding Skills**: Continuously improving my Python and R (C++ coming soon)

## âœ¨ Interests:
- **Astronomy**: Iâ€™m fascinated by the cosmos! From black holes to distant galaxies, I love learning about the universe and keeping up with the latest space missions and discoveries. ðŸŒŒ
- **Rocket League**: When I'm not analyzing data, you can find me scoring goals in Rocket League. Whether it's a casual game or a ranked grind, I'm all about that aerial play and epic saves! ðŸ¥…ðŸš—ðŸ’¨

## ðŸ“š Learning Goals:
- Master advanced statistics.
- Explore how machine learning can be applied to finance.
